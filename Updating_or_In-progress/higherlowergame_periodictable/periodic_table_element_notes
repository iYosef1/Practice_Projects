#Numerical Values & Grouping from Periodic Table:

#element symbol
#element name
#atomic number = number of protons = number of electrons
#atomic number, number of protons, number of electrons all are equivalent in neutral-atoms in periodic table, in nature
not always the case
#in periodic table, atomic number is usually reference to number of protons, not number of electrons
#atomic weight = number of protons + number of neutrons (+ number of electrons: very low almost nonexist mass)
#neutrons = atomic weight - number of protons (atomic number)
#group by properties, same number of valence electrons in outer shell (group 1 has 1 valence electron, group 2 has 2
valence electrons, etc.)
#groups are: alkali metal, alkaline earth metals, lanthanides, transition metals, post-transition metals, metalloids,
other non-metals, halogens, noble gases



#Theoretical Trends from Periodic Table:

#Atomic Radius:
#down the periodic table, atomic radius increases (because shell is being added)
#go to the right, atomic radius decreases (1 more proton added, pulling in radius)
#OVERALL: atomic radius increases going in the down-left direction

#Ionization Energy: energy required to remove an electron from an atom, always from the outer most shell.
#Electromagnetic force that attracts electrons to protons drops off very quickly with distance
#So farther away electron is from nucleus the easier it is to pull it away
#OVERALL: ionization increases going in the up-right direction (opposite trend of atomic radius)

#Electron Affinity (opposition of ionization energy): tells you how much an atom wants to gain an electron.
#noble gases have full outer shells so they can be disregarded
#F has highest electron affinity and Fr has the lowest, that is, Fr would rather lose an electron
#OVERALL: electron affinity increases going in the up-right direction

#Electronegativity: the ability of an atom to hold electrons tightly
#noble gases have full outer shells so they can be disregarded
#smaller atoms with more protons for energy level (or higher effective nuclear charge Z(eff)) will hold electrons best
#OVERALL: electronegativity increases going in the up-right direction


#Isssue 1: The following 4 trends cannot be used to make higher-lower comparisons between each other. Only within each
trend can a comparison be made between 2 elements.
#Issue 2: The numerical values cannot be used to make higher-lower comparisons against any of the trends.

#Solution: Numerical values have to be added to the dictionary for all of the trends

#Elements with +/- electrons are called... Non-neutral Atoms aka. Ions:
#Ionic Radius: electrons repel each other so adding electrons make atom bigger, and removing makes it smaller.
#Ions with same electronic configuration will have the radii decrease as atomic number increases
#(protons by default is referred to by atomic number in this context, also since electronic configuaration is same)

#Elements with +/- neutrons, with differing number of protons from neutrons' count are called... Isotopes

#Radioactive Elements: are elements that are found to be radioactive, only once found or accidentally created can that
element be replicated as a radioactive element have a varying amount of neutrons and protons that creates instability,
and decay always follows
#most radioactive elements are isotopes

#atoms constitute isotopes & radioactive elements; ions constitute non-radioactive and non-isotopic elements AND
radioactive and isotopic elements
